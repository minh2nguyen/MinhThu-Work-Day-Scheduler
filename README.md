# ðŸ—“ Work Day Scheduler - Third-Party APIs

## Description:
This work day scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each bussiness hour of the day. 

This application was designed using:
- HTML
- CSS 
- jQuery 

To work with the date, time, and hours in the scheduler: 
- Moment.js
- Day.js

## Functionality 
When the scheduler is open, the user is welcomed with the current DATE and TIME at the top of the calendar. 

As the user scrolls down, they are presented with blocks of times for standard bussiness hours from 9AM-5PM.

The timeblocks are colorcoded with three different colors to indicate whether the event is in the past, present, or future. 

The user can click on the time block and type in the plans they may have for the hour. When the save icon button is clicked, the plan that was typed out will be saved in a local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved events will remain.
